### Rob Beiko's Phylogeography Tutorial

These are the source files we will be using for our tutorial session on Tuesday. I am updating these files frequently; please feel free to take a look but keep in mind that this is a **work in progress** and calibrate your expectations appropriately :)

Overview:

 - phylogeo_tutorial.md: the tutorial walkthrough document.
 - Microreact\_isolates_filtered.csv: Isolate info to be loaded into Microreact.
 - Haiti\_cholera_tree.nwk: The Newick-format tree, for uploading into Microreact.
 - Maps for GenGIS: to be added.
 - GenGIS\_Cholera_locations.csv: The info for specific locations, to be used as input to GenGIS. Load this file after the map.
 - GenGIS\_Cholera_isolates.csv: The info for specific isolates, to be used as input to GenGIS. Load this file after the locations file.
 - Haiti\_cholera_tree.gtm: The Newick-format tree for loading into GenGIS. Note that this is _exactly the same_ as the .nwk tree above; but since both programs like different extensions (Microreact obligately so, as far as I can tell), I've allowed for some redundancy.
